            <div class="fontSizeTypes"><i>Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based
                    artificial turf, with a small, hard ball approximately
                    73 mm (2.9 in) in diameter. The game is popular among both males and females in many parts of the
                    world, particularly in Europe, Asia,
                    Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina. In most countries, the game is played between
                    single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.</i><br><br>

                <i> The governing body is the 126-member International Hockey Federation (FIH). Men's field hockey has
                    been played at each Summer Olympic Games since
                    1908 except for 1912 and 1924, while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic
                    Games since 1980.</i><br><br>

                <i> Modern field hockey sticks are constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon fibre
                    (sometimes both) and
                    are J-shaped, with a curved hook at the playing end, a flat surface on the playing side and a curved
                    surface on the rear
                    side. All sticks are right-handed â€“ left-handed sticks are not permitted.</i><br><br>

                <i>While field hockey in its current form appeared in mid-18th century England, primarily in schools, it
                    was not until the
                    first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established. The first club was created in 1849
                    at Blackheath in
                    south-east London. Field hockey is the national sport of Pakistan. It was the national sport of
                    India until the
                    Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports declared in August 2012 that India has no national
                    sport.</i><br>

            <div class="fontSizeTypes"><i>Bandy is played with a ball on a football pitch-sized ice arena (bandy rink),
                    typically outdoors, and with many rules similar to association football.
                    It is played professionally in Russia and Sweden and is considered a national sport in Russia. The
                    sport is recognized by the IOC; its international governing body is the
                    Federation of International Bandy.</i><br><br>

                <i> Bandy has its roots in England in the 19th century, was originally called "hockey on the ice", and
                    spread from England to other European countries around 1900;
                    a similar Russian sport can also be seen as a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is sometimes called
                    "Russian hockey". Bandy World Championships have been played since
                    1957 and Women's Bandy World Championships since 2004. There are national club championships in many
                    countries and the top clubs in the world play in the Bandy World
                    Cup every year.</i><br><br> <br>

            <div class="fontSizeTypes"><i>Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice,
                    using a three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) vulcanized rubber disc called a puck.
                    This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on
                    the ice. The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying
                    extents in many other countries around the world. It is the most popular sport in Canada, Finland,
                    Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Ice hockey is the national sport of
                    Latvia and the national winter sport of Canada.Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all
                    ages.</i><br><br>

                <i> The governing body of international play is the 77-member International Ice Hockey Federation
                    (IIHF). Men's ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924
                    , and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. Women's ice hockey was added to the Winter Olympics in 1998.
                    North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the strongest professional
                    ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly
                    different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories.
                    International ice hockey rules were adopted from Canadian rules in the early 1900s</i><br><br>

                <i> Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the
                    bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held
                    upright and can legally curve either way, for left- or right-handed players.</i><br><br>
